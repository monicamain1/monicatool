The "multi-thread" parameter refers to the capability of the monitoring system to monitor a multi-threaded workload.

In computer architecture, multithreading is the ability of a CPU (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system. Generally, in a multithreaded application the threads share the resources of a single or multiple cores, which include the computing units, the CPU caches, and the translation lookaside buffer.

It may be:
- Yes
- No
- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.
- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.
