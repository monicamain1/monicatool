The "hardware target" parameter refers to the hardware target monitored by the on-chip monitoring system. 

It may be:
- SPP:  it refers to a single-purpose processor, namely a digital systemt designed to execute specific tasks.
- GPP: it refers to a programmable general-purpose processor, namely a digital system designed to execute programs, i.e., algorithms expressed with opportune instructions part of an instruction-set. 
- GPU: it refers to all the graphical processing units.
- ARM: it refers to all the GPPs with ARM architecture.
- Microblaze: it refers to all the GPPs with Xilinx MicroBlaze architecture.
- RISC-V: it refers to all the GPPs with RISC-V architecture.
- AMBA AHB bus: it refers to AMBA AHB based implementations.
- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.
- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.
