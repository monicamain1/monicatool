The "hardware target" parameter refers to the hardware target monitored by the on-chip monitoring system. 

It may be:
- GPP: it refers to a general programmable processor, namely a digital system that executes a program, i.e., an algorithm expressed with opportune instructions part of an instruction-set. 
- SPP:  it refers to a single-purpose processor, namely a digital circuit designed to execute some specific tasks, without being reprogrammable.
- GPU: it refers to all the graphical processing units.
- ARM: it refers to all the GPP with ARM architecture.
- Microblaze: it refers to all the GPP with Xilinx MicroBlaze architecture.
- RISC-V: it refers to all the GPP with RISC-V architecture.
- AMBA AHB bus: it refers to AMBA AHB based implementations.
- Not Applicable
-- when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching on-chip monitoring systems resulting When used in Insert Mode, it means that the definition of this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.
