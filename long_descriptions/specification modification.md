The "specification modification" parameter refers to how much the behavior of the UUM needs to be modified in order to adopt the monitoring system.

Set of possibe values:

- unknown: it is not possibleto evaluate such a parameter

- value (%): from 0 % (i.e., no modifications needed) to 100 % (i.e., the specification shall be completely rewritten)

- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.

- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.
