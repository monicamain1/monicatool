The Type of Physical Implementation refers to the physical implementation of the UUM. In other words, the Type of Physical Implementation (TPI) refers to the type of physical platform where the monitoring system can perform the monitoring action. The following values can be assumed by TPI parameter:
- Completely fixed (CF): this TPI refers to hardwired implementations. They can be, for example, a hardwired PP (such as Intel ATOM) or a hardwired SPP.
- Reconfigurable (RCF): this TPI refers to reconfigurable logic based implementations, such as implementations on FPGAs.
- Partially fixed (PF): this TPI represents a mix of the first two, such as the case of Xilinx Zynq7000 where there is a dual-core hardwired processor with an FPGA in the same chip.
