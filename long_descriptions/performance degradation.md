The "performance degradation" parameter refers to the maximum timing overhead caused by the use of the monitoring system.

The possible values are the following ones

- value (cc): a number or a range related to the average execution time increase (in clck cycles) due to the use of the OCMS.

- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.

- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.

For example: performance degradation < 10 cc; performance degradation in the range 50-100 cc.
