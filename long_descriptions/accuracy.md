The "accuracy" parameter refers to the level of accuracy (relative to an actual value or absolute) of the measurements done with the monitoring system.

Set of possible values:

- unknown: it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value (%): a number related to the relative error or to the percentage of correct classifications/responses.

For example: relative error <1%; recognition of an element in a set correct at least 80% of the times; true/false responses correct at least 95% of the times.
