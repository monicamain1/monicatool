The "physical cost" parameter refers to the maximum cost, in terms of occupied area, of the physical components added to the platform where the UUM is executed.

The possible values are the following ones:

-unknown: it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value: is a number or a range related to the average physical cost increase (i.e., number of LUT, flip-flop, etc.) due to the implementation of the OCMS (i.e., to implement M_INF and M_PRO).
