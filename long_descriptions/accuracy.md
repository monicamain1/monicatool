The "accuracy" parameter refers to the level of accuracy (relative to an actual value or absolute) of the measurements done with the monitoring system.

Set of possible values:

- unknown: it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value (%): a number related to the relative error or to the percentage of correct classifications/responses.

- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.

- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.

For example: relative error <1%; recognition of an element in a set correct at least 80% of the times; true/false responses correct at least 95% of the times.
