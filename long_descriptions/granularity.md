This parameter refers to the nature of the events that can be collected by the monitoring system. The granularity can be:
Architectural: they comprise events that remain consistent across different processor architectures,e.g.,instructions,branches, cycles.
Micro-Architectural: they consist of events that are specific to the micro-architecture of a given processor, e.g.,cache accesses, branch prediction, and TLB accesses.
