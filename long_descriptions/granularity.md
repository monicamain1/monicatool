The "granularity" parameter refers to the nature of the events that can be collected by the monitoring system.

The possible values are the following ones:

- Architectural: they comprise events that remain consistent across different processor architectures,e.g.,instructions,branches, cycles.

- Micro-Architectural: they consist of events that are specific to the micro-architecture of a given processor, e.g.,cache accesses, branch prediction, and TLB accesses.

-Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.

-Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.
