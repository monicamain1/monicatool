This parameter refers to the capability of the monitoring system to raise an exception.

The exception can be in the form of an interrupt, or more in general in the form of a special signal.

The parameter can take two values: 
- Yes
- No


In digital computers, an interrupt is a signal sent to a processor to require the attention from the software executing on that processor. An interrupt alerts the processor and serves as a request for the processor to interrupt the currently executing code when permitted, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner. If the request is accepted, the processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event.
