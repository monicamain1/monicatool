The "metrics" parameter refers to the metrics that the on-chip monitoring system is able to collect. 

It may be:
- Number of Available CPUs
- Number of Instruction Cache Misses
- Number of Instruction cache Hits
- Number of Data Cache Misses
- Number of Data Cache hits
- Processor utilization
- Number of pipeline stalls
- Number of retired instructions
- Number of TLB misses
- Number of pipeline flushes
- Load distribution of application on processor cores
- Number of RAM read accesses
- Number of RAM write accesses
- Number of instruction fetches
- Latency of application execution (i.e., response time)
- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.
- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.
