The "performance degradation" parameter refers to the maximum timing overhead caused by the use of the monitoring system.

The possible values are the following ones

- unknown: it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value (cc): a number or a range related to the average execution time increase (in clck cycles) due to the use of the OCMS.

For example: performance degradation < 10 cc; performance degradation in the range 50-100 cc.
