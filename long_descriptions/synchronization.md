This parameter refers to the required synchronization among elements that implement MI, MB, MP, in order to correctly perform the monitoring action. The synchronization can be Automatic or Manual. The former indicates that the synchronization does not require actions, as it is guaranteed by the use of the monitoring system itself: this is the case, for example, of a user space operating system application monitored with the technique of source level code instrumentation, where the compilation process ensures the correct synchronization among MB, MI and MP. On the other hand, manual indicates that a hardware/software custom component is required to guarantee the synchronization.
