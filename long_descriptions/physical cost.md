The "physical cost" parameter refers to the maximum cost, in terms of occupied area, of the physical components added to the platform where the UUM is executed.

The possible values are the following ones:

- unknown: it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value: is a number or a range related to the average physical cost increase (i.e., number of LUT, flip-flop, etc.) due to the implementation of the OCMS (i.e., to implement M_INF and M_PRO).

- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, only the on-chip monitoring systems with this parameter set as "Not Applicable" will be considered. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.

- Not Declared: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not declared for the considered monitoring requirements. Therefore, when searching for on-chip monitoring systems satisfying those monitoring requirements, this parameter will not be kept into account. When used in Insert Mode, it means that this parameter is not declared for the described on-chip monitoring system.
