The "hardware target" parameter refers to the hardware target monitored by the on-chip monitoring system. 

It may be:
- GPP: a general programmable processor is a digital system that executes a program, i.e., an algorithm expressed with opportune instructions part of an instruction-set. 
- SPP:  a single-purpose processor is a digital circuit designed to execute some specific tasks, without being reprogrammable.
- GPU: it refers to all the graphical processing units.
- ARM: it refers to all the GPP with ARM architecture.
- Microblaze: it refers to all the GPP with Xilinx MicroBlaze architecture.
- RISC-V: it refers to all the GPP with RISC-V architecture.
- AMBA AHB bus: it refers to AMBA AHB based implementations.
- Not Applicable: when used in Find Mode, it means that the requirement of this parameter is not applicable for the considered monitoring requirements. When used in Insert Mode, it means that the definition of this parameter is not applicable for the described on-chip monitoring system.
- Not Declared:
