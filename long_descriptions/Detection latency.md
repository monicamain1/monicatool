The "detection latency" parameter refers to the elapsed time between the instant in which the event instance to be observed happens and the instant where the monitoring information is available.

The set of possible values are the followingones:

- unknown: means that it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value (cc): is a number or a range related to the detection latency value related to clock cycles.

For example: detection latency < 4 cc; detection latency in the range 10-50 cc.
