The "poer dissipation" parameter refers to the maximum power dissipation cost related to the use of the monitoring system.

Set of possible values:

- unknown: it is not possible to evaluate such a parameter

- value (mW): is a number or a range related to the average power dissipation increase due to the use of the OCMS.
