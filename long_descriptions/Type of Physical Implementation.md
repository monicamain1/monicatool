The "Type of Physical Implementation" (TPI) parameter refers to the physical implementation of the UUM. In other words, TPI refers to the type of physical platform where the monitoring system can perform the monitoring action.

The possible values are the following ones:

- Completely fixed (CF): this TPI refers to hardwired implementations. They can be, for example, a hardwired GPP (such as Intel ATOM) or a hardwired SPP without any available reconfigurable logic.

- Reconfigurable (RCF): this TPI refers to reconfigurable logic based implementations, such as implementations on FPGAs.

- Partially fixed (PF): this TPI represents a mix of the first two, such as the case of Xilinx Zynq7000 where there is a dual-core hardwired processor with an FPGA in the same chip.
